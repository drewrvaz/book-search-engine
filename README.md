## Description
As an avid reader, I wanted to create an application where I can easily search for new books to read. Once I have found new books that I would like to read, I can add them to a list of books that will be saved. This was a really fun project, getting to combine MongoDB and react into one application that can help me find books easily. Here's the URL to the live application: https://salty-forest-74683.herokuapp.com/
