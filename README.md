## Description
As an avid reader, I wanted to create an application where I can easily search for new books to read. Once I have found new books that I would like to read, I can add them to a list of books that will be saved. This was a really fun project, getting to combine MongoDB and react into one application that can help me find books easily. Here's the URL to the live application: https://salty-forest-74683.herokuapp.com/
## Installation
Pull the repo from github, run npm i to install all dependencies, then run npm run develop to begin using the application.
## Usage
Create a profile or login to your already created profile. Then start searching books. When you find some that you want to read, click the save button and it will be added to your collection of saved books.
